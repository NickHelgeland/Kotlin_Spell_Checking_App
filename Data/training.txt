As a reviewer, I’m only rarely going to hve time and incliation to try to reproduce your results. I’m judging your work based on the arguent you’re makking (filtered through my own experience, of course). Part of that argument is that you’re a competent researcher, and while I’ll give a great deal of leeway for peeople who don’t have English as their first langauge, I do expect competent researchers to know how to use a spellchecker. If you choose not to, I may not give you the benefit of the doubt when it comes to competence for the more important areas of your papper.
